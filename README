This is just an embarrassingly simple Python package to get the number of bits
in a byte (i.e. char) by making the `CHAR_BIT` standard macro of C available as
an `int` constant.

For local testing on GNU/Linux run:

    $ bash build.sh

For virtual-environment and/or system-wide installation and compilation run:

    # python setup.py install
